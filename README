    COMPILING ON LINUX

MibiCraft is straightforward to compile on linux: in the project folder run

$ meson setup build

and run

$ meson compile -C build

to compile it. You may need to run it multiple times before it succeeds.

    COMPILING ON WINDOWS

I can't test it on modern windows versions. I'm only testing it on Windows XP

See the instructions in building_on_win32.txt to compile it on Windows XP.
